<p><strong>Hey Guys!</strong> In this blog-post we are going to pwn <strong>Legacy</strong> from <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a>.</p>

<p>It is a Windows-based box and is super duper easy.</p>

<p>First, we scan the box to find only 2 services. Then we exploit two infamously popular bugs to get into the system. However, I am not going to use <strong>Metasploit</strong> for exploitation.</p>

<p>With that said, let us begin.</p>

<p>A default script (sC) and service version (sV) NMAP scan reveals ports 139 and 445 to be open.</p>

<p>So we have SMB service running on the box.</p>

<p>Judging by the version of the windows (Windows XP) and SMB service, I decided to do a SMB-vuln scan using NMAP.</p>

<p>Our vulnerability scan gives us some useful results. The box is vulnerable to two infamous <strong>SMB Bugs</strong> namely <strong>MS08-067</strong> and <strong>MS17-010</strong>. Any one of the two bugs can be exploitted to get a system-level access on the box.</p>

<p>Both of them have an exploit on <strong>Metasploit</strong>. But let us do the exploitation in a manual way.</p>

<h1 id="exploiting-ms08-067"><a href="#header-1"></a>EXPLOITING MS08-067:</h1>

<p>There are lots of public exploits available for this bug on Github. However, I am going to use <a href="https://github.com/andyacer/ms08_067">this</a>. You can clone the same on your local box.</p>

<p>The only prerequisite for this is : you should have <strong>impacket</strong> version <strong>0.9.17</strong>. This normally comes default with Kali Linux, so you do not need to worry. However, if you do not have, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/">here</a>.</p>
